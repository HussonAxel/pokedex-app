# Pokedex Project

This Pokedex application leverages the PokeAPI to fetch and display detailed Pokémon information. It's designed as a learning project with a focus on TypeScript and PandaCSS, starting with a React-based frontend. Plans for future development include adding a backend powered by AdonisJS 6 and Inertia.js, as well as integrating a testing tool to ensure application reliability and performance.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Used for building the dynamic and interactive user interface of the Pokedex. React's component-based approach allows for efficient development of reusable UI elements.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances code quality and maintainability by adding static types to JavaScript, ensuring type safety throughout the project.
- **PandaCSS**: A lightweight and minimalistic CSS framework that provides the styling foundation for the application, offering a clean and modern user interface.
- **PokeAPI**: Serves as the primary data source, offering comprehensive Pokémon information that the application utilizes to present to the users.
- **AdonisJS 6** (Planned): Will be used to develop a robust backend, introducing features like user authentication, data management, and more.
- **Inertia.js** (Planned): Aims to seamlessly integrate the React frontend with the AdonisJS backend, providing an SPA-like experience without the complexity of an API.
- **Testing Tool** (Planned): A testing framework/tool will be integrated to ensure the quality and reliability of the application. The specific tool is yet to be determined.

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Implementing AdonisJS 6 and Inertia.js to evolve the project into a full-stack application.
- **Testing**: Integration of a testing framework/tool to automate testing, improve code quality, and ensure application stability.
- **Feature Expansion**: Adding more interactive features and comprehensive Pokémon data to enrich the user experience.

## Learning Goals

- **TypeScript**: Gain a deeper understanding of TypeScript's capabilities, focusing on leveraging its type system for better code reliability and developer experience.
- **PandaCSS**: Explore the effectiveness of using PandaCSS in crafting responsive and visually appealing web designs.
